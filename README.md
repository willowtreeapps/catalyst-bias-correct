# catalyst-bias-correct
A Slack Application that identifies and corrects unconscious gender bias in messages and conversations

# Introduction
The #BiasCorrect Plug-In is designed to help users fight their unconscious gender bias, by flagging it to them during real-time conversations on Slack and offering up alternative bias-free words or phrases. Think spell check, but for gender bias.

Weâ€™re releasing The #BiasCorrect Plug-In code in hopes that other people will take it and adapt it for their own platforms so that we can rid the workplace of gender bias, once and for all.
